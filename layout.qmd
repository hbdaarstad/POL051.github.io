There are four primary quadrants in RStudio:

- **Source pane**
- **Console pane**
- **Environment pane**
- **Output pane**

The **source pane** allows us to edit and view various code-related files, such as `.R`, `.rmd`, `.qmd`, `.py`, `.css`, or general text files such as `.txt` or `.md`.

- To open an existing file, use either the **File → Open File...** menu or the **Recent Files** menu to select from recently opened files.
- You can create a new file via the **File → New File** menu.

The **console pane** provides an area to interactively execute code.

The **environment pane** includes the Environment, History, Connections, Build, and Version Control System (VCS) tabs and displays any currently saved objects.

The **output pane** displays various outputs, such as plots, and contains the Files, Plots, R Packages, Help, Tutorial, Viewer, and Presentation tabs.
