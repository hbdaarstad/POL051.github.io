In R, we save our data in what we call objects! Objects store information about different types of elements. If you know any other coding languages, they typically call these variables.

```{r}

# The <- saves the caculation as math
math <- 10 + 2
#print()
print(math)

```

```{r}

# The = saves the caculation as math
math = 10 + 2
# print() will print out what is saved in the object math
print(math)

```
