**Packages** are collections of R functions, data, and code compiled in a well-defined format. **R functions** are like the verbs of the R coding language, they tell your computer what action to make with sets of information. A function is usually defined by a keyword and then parenthesis. Functions can be built by yourself or pre-built.

Some packages come pre-installed in R, however, the majority do not, so you need to install them first using the r function `install.packages`

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| include: true

install.packages("tidyverse") # first install this package
install.packages("remotes") # second install this package to download the data

```

After installing the packages we need to attach the package. You will always need to reattach the a package in order to use it when you restart R. You can do this by using the function `library()` and the name of the package.

In the following examples we will be using a collection of data sets I have cleaned and you will download by using the following code:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| include: true
# This line of code installs a data package saved on github that I
# created
remotes::install_github("hbdaarstad/RandomData")

```

```{r}
#| include: false
# attaches the packages
library(tidyverse)
library(RandomData)
```

Now, we can begin using functions found in the `tidyverse` package and data from my package `RandomData`. Let's work with our first data set, `race_stats`.

```{r}
?race_stats # description of the data
```
