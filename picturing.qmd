The `head()` and `str()` allow us to get a snap shot of the data and see what is in it and what data types we are working with. `head()` shows us the first six observations of each variable, while `str()` shows us the structure of each variable.

```{r}
library(RandomData)

dat <- race_stats

head(dat)  
```

```{r}
str(dat) # structure of dataset

```
